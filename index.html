                    Building Blox Description
                    Building Blox: A Strong Foundation for Lifelong Learning
                    
                    At Nook N Steps, we understand that early diagnosis of dyslexia or other reading challenges can be overwhelming for both parents and children. Thatâ€™s why we created Building Blox, a specialized program designed to provide the right tools, guidance, and support for young learners in the critical early stages of their literacy journey.
                    
                    The Power of Phonetic Learning
                    Building Blox is centered around phonetic learning, a research-backed approach proven to be one of the most effective ways to help children develop strong reading skills. By focusing on phonics, we help children decode words, recognize patterns, and build confidence in their ability to read and write. Our program nurtures a child's natural curiosity and equips them with the skills they need to navigate the world of literacy with ease.
                    
                    Who Is This Program For?
                    This program is specifically designed for first through third graders who have recently been diagnosed with dyslexia or are struggling with early literacy skills. At this stage of development, children are highly receptive to structured learning approaches, making it the perfect time to introduce phonetic strategies that will set them up for future success. 
            </p>

                    <li>Phonics-Based Lessons: Engaging, multisensory lessons that help children understand the connection between letters and sounds.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Guided Reading Sessions: Interactive reading activities to improve fluency and comprehension.</li>

                    <li>Hands-on Learning Materials: Access to books, worksheets, and phonics games that reinforce concepts in a fun and memorable way.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Bi-Weekly Check-Ins: Our educators provide regular check-ins to monitor progress, offer personalized feedback, and adjust learning plans as needed.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Parental Support & Resources: Resources and guidance for parents to reinforce learning at home.</li>

                <h1> Choose Building Blox?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                Our program is built on the belief that every child deserves a strong start in their literacy journey. Hereâ€™s why Building Blox stands out:
                
                Individualized Support: Each childâ€™s learning journey is unique, which is why our program offers personalized guidance based on their needs.
                
                Confidence Boosting Approach: Many children with reading difficulties struggle with self-esteem. By providing structured, step-by-step support, we help them develop confidence in their abilities.
                
                Engaging & Interactive Methods: Learning should never feel like a chore! Our program incorporates visual, auditory, and kinesthetic activities to make literacy engaging and accessible.
                
                A Safe and Encouraging Environment: We create a space where children feel comfortable, supported, and encouraged to take risks in their learning.
                
                Building a Brighter Future
                With Building Blox, we aim to lay the groundwork for a lifetime of learning success. By nurturing early literacy skills, we not only help children become better readers but also foster a love for learning that extends beyond the classroom.
                
                If you are looking for a structured, supportive, and effective program to help your child thrive, Building Blox is here to guide them every step of the way!

                Pathfinder: Building Independence and Academic Skills

                At Nook N Steps, we understand that as students transition into high school and beyond, they require the tools and confidence to take charge of their education. Pathfinder is designed for older students who have either completed our earlier programs or need a structured approach to enhancing their academic skills. Our program fosters independence, self-advocacy, and critical thinking, ensuring that students are well-prepared for their future academic and personal endeavors.
                
                Preparing for the Future
                
                The Pathfinder program supports students who are ready to take a more active role in their education. Whether they are in high school or preparing for higher education, we equip them with the necessary skills to manage their learning, improve comprehension, and develop essential study habits. By focusing on self-reliance and problem-solving, students gain the confidence to tackle more complex academic challenges.

<!-- AI usage:
 I used it to help format my table to make it with CSS styling. I also used chat to help find any missing semicolons. I asked "why is my css not showing up? and it showed I was missing two semicolons"

Getting the buttons to actually scroll to locations. I asked chat how to do that. the question I asked was "how do you get the button to go to another part of the page" and it gave me an A tag opition on an on click button with the button tag. 

I asked chat what a "tooltip was and how to make one work" I took that and wrote made my own HTML and used the coded it gave for the css and changed it so it fit my page.

Used it for figuring out the right layout to right the favicon. I was not sure how to impliment this and it only shows up on google chrome not safari. 

I asked it to help create the discriptions for the different programs that I am "selling" as my product

I asked chat how to best style a table, I knew hot to make it but did not know hot to style. It gave a bunch of options and I used it to create what is on my css.
